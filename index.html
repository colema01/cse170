1.)    (20 pts) This past week was important because we were able to put everything we have done in class together and look at it in a big picture. All of the things we have learned thus far has taught us about true professionalism. 
<br>
2.)    (20 pts) I think being professional in general really helps your team out. Being professional includes, Accountability, Consideration, Humility, Communication, Tidiness, Kindness, Consistency,  Treat Others with Respect, and  Keep Your Word. These are all from the prepare module and by doing these things, you will be able ton contribute better than ever to a team. 
<br>
3.)    (20 pts) This week really made me reflect the professionalism from the different jobs I have had. I worked at McDonalds in High School and was even given the opportunity to be a manager. Even being a manager, that workplace was not professionalism of the job. 
<br>
4.)    (20 pts) How I would relate this to the gospel would be how we dress and act at church and in the temple. We dress in our nicest clothes when we go to church to show love and respect to Heavenly Father. Not only do we dress professionaly, but we act in reverance as well. We do this so then we can be intune with the spirit and in a way be a team with the Holy Ghost and Heavenly Father. Being professional in and at church has been important since the beginning of time. 
<br>
5.)    (20 pts) Something that I helped someone learn this week was about the personal project. He didn't understand how or why it is important to know who you are first before leading a team. I told him it is important because inorder to be professional, you need to know your own limits. Everyone has a point where their professionalism may wear down or even wear out. It is important to keep your professionalism alive as you lead a team to lead by example.

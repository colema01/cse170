1.)    (20 pts) This week we have been working in our groups a lot. I think this is important because we have been learning a lot about working as a team and in groups. Since we are actually practicing it now, it has been reall ygood learnign experience for all of us. 
<br>
2.)    (20 pts) I plan on making sure my team is updated with the amount of time we have all collectivly put in. We have made a group chat and we all put in the time we personally have put towards the project and add it from there.

3.)    (20 pts) This has been really fun workin in group projects. I used to do this a lot in High School, but in college I haven't done much of it. I have been looking back a lot recently to my previous experiences with group projects and we have all been staying on top of it. 
<br>
4.)    (20 pts) We all relate to eachother by collectively putting our time in towards the project. This has been a great thing to see because the more time spent with eachother, the greater we know eachother and eachotheres skills, talents, hobbies, and so on.
<br>
5.)    (20 pts) We can relate this to the gospel by saying every deciple of Christ no matter which religion, works/should work together to bring othrs joy, happiness, and love. It is through groups of people that His message is brought to pass.

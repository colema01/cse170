1.)    (20 pts) This weeks topic was important for teamwork because we were able to get to know ourselves even more. I have said this before but really getting to know your self really helps a team since you get to know what your strengths and weaknesses are. The web map we did in class really great at helping us to get to know ourselves better.

2.)    (20 pts)  I plan on knowing my strengths and what I can offer to the team better. There are skills and talents that people have that others don't, so being comfortable to sharing my talents is what I can do to help my team better.

3.)    (20 pts)  Based off my experiences this past week, my career exploration class I am taking really connects a lot to what we are covering in this class. This past week I had to take a personality test again and other tests to know what my strengths and talents are. So its really cool how both of these classes are really helping me to know myself better and become a better teammate.

4.)    (20 pts)  My experiences relates to everyone elses by digging in deep with who we actually are. It's been fun because there has been some things I've laerned about myself that I never knew.
<br>
5.)    (20 pts)  The way I'd relate this in a gospel sense is finding yourself worth. Heavenly Father has given us all spiritual talents and gifts that are uniquly meant for you. We are given these gifts to help others and build zion here on earth.

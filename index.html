1.)    (20 pts) This weeks topic was important because we were able to learn what type of managment we prefer to work for. If we are more of the type of person to do exactly what is asked or be the creative and self motivated one. These are seprated by x and y.

2.)    (20 pts) After taking the quiz that was handed out durning class on Wednesday, I learned that I can contribute to the team weather thats around my team or working by myself for the team. I am easily self motivated and driven, which could help the team with any tasks that are meant to be done by one or few people.

3.)    (20 pts) I think something that I had experienced that everyone else did as well was understanding if you are a follower type person or a leading type person. I noticed everyone around me at my table were all completly Y or mostly Y meaning we all like to be creative and are self motived and, relitivly speaking, would excel at leading.

4.)    (20 pts) If I had to relate this to a Gospel sense, I'd say its important for us to be more X than Y. Obedience is a law that Heavenly Father takes very seriously as it is the frist law in heaven. As we are obedient and listen to God's and Chirst's example, we are able to live happy lives and return back to him.

5.)    (20 pts) Something that I taught someone was it's okay to follow sometimes. Someone at my table said that they want to be a leader and can't imagine being a follower their whole career. Eventhough I agreed with them to an extent, its important to know that the best leaders are the best followers. Again when we look at Christ and His perfect life, He was the greatest follower to his Father than anyone ever has or will be.

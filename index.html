1.)    (20 pts) I liekd this weeks topic a lot because we are going to do projects with other team members. Planning these projects allow ourselves to get to know eachother better and see how others work with the team. 
<br>
2.)    (20 pts) What I have been doing to help the team is sending announcements on I learn and figuring out where everyone is at. We have a google doc and me and only one person has really done it and it has been a little frustrating. 
<br>
3.)    (20 pts) I think everyone is feeling the same feelings of stress becuase we still have to get quite a bit doen with our proposal. We are contacting eachother and making sure we get it all squared away so than we can get a good grade and get to have fun doing fun things together. 
<br>
4.)    (20 pts) I have had groups before that had a couple people who don't pull their weight and it is frustrating. Since we are in a teamwork class, I am going to do my best to make sure everyone is doing their part. I won't do this by myself, I will have other group members do the same so than we are all working on this together.

5.)    (20 pts) You could relate this to the gospel by looking at the orginization of Christ church. Everone has a role to play to help serve, uplift, and edify others. The only way Christ's church is able to reach all of the world and makea difference in the world is by workign as a team and everyond doing their parts.

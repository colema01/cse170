1.)    (20 pts) This weeks topic was important because it taught us that being the minority isn't a bad thing, but can offer different ideas and thoughts to a problem the team is tryign to resolve. 
<br>
2.)    (20 pts) Something that I can do to help the team more is simply speaking up and sharing my ideas more. Most of the time when I am quiet, my ideas are with everyone elses, but there are those times when my ideas are in the minority and could have potential ot help the team and the project.

3.)    (20 pts) My exeperience with the game we played Tuesday was about half the time I was in the majority and the other half I was in the minority. These basically sums up my thinking pretty well with the ideas and my creative skills that I have. 
<br>
4.)    (20 pts) I think that class and the game we played was pretty eye opening to everyone. It is important for all team members to be confident and comfortable to share their ideas with everyone. A simple and small idea could be a game changer to what ever the group is working on.

5.)    (20 pts) This week relates to religon because being a Christian today is the minority. The world does not want to follow the commandments and God's law. Many people are making very wrong choices, but if they chose to follow Christ and be different from the world, they would be able to find that lasting happiness that they are looking for.
